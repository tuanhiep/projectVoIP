How to execute my application?


First, to run the application, we must set the library for it:

The application needs two libraries:

1> jain-sip
2> libjitsi

We can find two ones in the folder Lib_Tel

But, for the part native of libjitsi, in ubuntu, we must set the java.library.path 

In NetBean, right click the project --> Set Configuration --> Customize --> 

  In the field of VM Options, set the path like that :


-Djava.library.path="your_repertory/Lib_Tel/libjitsi/lib/native/linux-64"


in which your_repertory is the repertory in your computer to find the folder Lib_Tel

Example: 

-Djava.library.path="/home/canhchimbang/NetBeansProjects/group6voip/Lib_Tel/libjitsi/lib/native/linux-64"

To run the application,

Right-click the file: Telephone.java and click Run-file
